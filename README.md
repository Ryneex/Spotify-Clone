# Spotify Clone
this app is made with the help of spotify api. Huge shoutout to spotify, make sure to show them some love. it's not as good as the real one but I tried. It doesn't have a built it audio player because spotify do not allow that without a premium spotify account. So i had to use embed -_-

## Guide

You have to get a Client ID from Spotify dashboard and then change it in .env file. You can't login to the Clone app without your own Client ID

### Step 1
Login to your spotify account from https://developer.spotify.com/

### Step 2
Navigate to spotify dashboard https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and Create a new app with redirect uri http://localhost:5173 make sure to click the **Web API** checkbox. after creating the new app, navigate to settings from top right and then copy the Client ID

### Step 3
download this repository and then inside .env file, change the Client ID with your own.

## Step 4
run the following commands in terminal (make sure that you have nodejs installed)

```npm install```

```npm run dev```
