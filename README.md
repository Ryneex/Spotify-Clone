# Spotify Clone
this app is made with the help of spotify api. Huge shoutout to spotify, make sure to show them some love. it's not as good as the real one but I tried. It doesn't have a built it audio player because spotify do not allow that without a premium spotify account. So i had to use embed -_-

### Step 4
All is done. now you can login
